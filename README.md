# SASS Basics & Projects

This repository contains my learning journey with **SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets)**, including the basics and various projects I built while following the **Huxn WebDev** course on YouTube.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
SASS is a powerful preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more. This repo includes:
- SASS fundamentals and syntax
- Compiling SASS to CSS
- Advanced styling techniques
- Projects built using SASS

2. Install SASS globally (if not installed):

   npm install -g sass
   ```
3. Compile SASS to CSS:
